DashCash is an m-health application that rewards you with e-money for being fit. The money would be
provided by health insurance companies, as by keeping their customers fit, we are decreasing the
number of health claims and eventually saving them from paying lacs of rupees. DashCash will motivate
people for being fit and additionally, will help insurance companies optimize their incurred ratio. As a
first step, DashCash users have to select an insurance plan from a range of options provided. Based on
the insurance plan and distance covered (measured through pedometer), they would be receiving
incentives in their e-wallet. Users may use the app without opting for an insurance plan where they
wouldn't be receiving any monetary benefits, just track of their fitness level. The implementation of ML in
terms of recommending short-term/long-term goal settings and distance to be covered based on the
user history will lead to an all-round customer-centric experience.
